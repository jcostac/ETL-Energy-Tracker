My parquet folder structure should be as follows:

processed_data/
  year=2025/
    month=04/
      volumenes_{mercado}.parquet  # April 2025 data for {mercado} --> input paramter based on download from a particular energy market 
    month=05/
      volumenes_{mercado}.parquet  # May 2025 data "" ""


The function that processes parquets should take a df as input, and the month as input to calssify the parquet in a particular fol√±der. 

Parquets can be volumenes, precios, or ingresos a the moment.   

We are gonna process from a raw parquet folder where we will dump all dfs as csvs.
